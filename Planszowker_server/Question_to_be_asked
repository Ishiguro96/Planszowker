Questions that HAVE TO be answered soon:

* Should I use UDP or TCP/IP?
    -> TCP/IP is more relevant for communication (it does have confirmation that we send the data)
    -> TCP/IP is slower, but is speed a criteria?
    -> UDP is fast, but we have no confirmation we have delivered our sent data
